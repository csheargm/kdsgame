# Mission 3: Prompt Engineering - Player Guide

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear, effective instructions for AI tools. Just like giving directions to a friend, the better your instructions, the better the results!

## How to Play Mission 3

### Getting There
1. Complete Mission 1 (Train Your Image Classifier)
2. Complete Mission 2 (AI Ethics Challenge)
3. Mission 3 will automatically start!

### Gameplay

Mission 3 has **5 progressive levels**, each teaching a different aspect of prompt engineering:

#### Level 1: Be Specific
**Lesson**: Good prompts include specific details

**Example Scenario**: "You want an AI to help you write a story about space."

**Bad Prompt**: "Write a story about space"

**What to Include**:
- Genre (adventure, mystery, science)
- Characters (astronaut, alien, robot)
- Setting (future, Mars, space station)
- Audience (kids, teens)
- Length (short, 200 words)

**Good Prompt Example**:
> "Write a short adventure story (about 200 words) for kids aged 10-12 about a young astronaut who discovers a friendly alien on Mars in the year 2050."

---

#### Level 2: Add Context
**Lesson**: Tell the AI what you know and where you're stuck

**Example Scenario**: "You need help solving a math word problem for homework."

**Bad Prompt**: "Help me with math"

**What to Include**:
- What math topic (algebra, geometry)
- What grade level
- What you've tried already
- What specific part is confusing
- How you want help (explanation, steps)

**Good Prompt Example**:
> "I'm in 7th grade and working on solving equations with variables on both sides. I tried to solve '3x + 5 = 2x + 12' but I'm confused about what to do when the variable is on both sides. Can you explain the steps?"

---

#### Level 3: Iterative Refinement
**Lesson**: Don't be afraid to refine and improve your prompts

**Example Scenario**: "You asked an AI to create a recipe, but the result was too complicated."

**Bad Prompt**: "Make it simpler"

**What to Include**:
- What specifically was too complicated
- Your skill level
- Available ingredients/tools
- Time constraints
- Specific simplifications needed

**Good Prompt Example**:
> "Can you simplify this recipe for a beginner? I'd like it to have 5 ingredients or less, take under 30 minutes, and not require any special equipment. I've never baked before."

---

#### Level 4: Specify Format
**Lesson**: Tell the AI how you want information organized

**Example Scenario**: "You need information about climate change for a school presentation."

**Bad Prompt**: "Tell me about climate change"

**What to Include**:
- Desired format (bullet points, table, outline)
- Specific aspects to cover
- Purpose (presentation, essay)
- How much information
- Complexity level

**Good Prompt Example**:
> "Create a bulleted list of 5 main causes of climate change and 5 key effects, written in simple language for a 6th grade presentation. Format it so I can easily add it to slides."

---

#### Level 5: Master Prompt
**Lesson**: Combine everything - specificity, context, format, and constraints

**Example Scenario**: "You want to use AI to help you prepare for a science fair project about renewable energy."

**Bad Prompt**: "Help with my science fair project"

**What to Include**:
- Specific topic (solar, wind, hydro)
- Type of help needed
- What you've done so far
- Constraints (time, materials, budget)
- Format of help needed
- Grade level
- Learning goals

**Good Prompt Example**:
> "I'm an 8th grader working on a science fair project about solar energy. I need to design a simple experiment that demonstrates how solar panels work, using materials under $20 that I can find at home or a hardware store. Can you provide a step-by-step plan including: 1) the scientific concept I'm demonstrating, 2) materials needed, 3) experiment procedures, and 4) what results to expect? I have 2 weeks to complete this."

## Scoring System

Each level is scored out of 100 points based on:

- **Keyword Matching** (60-90 points): Including relevant concepts
- **Length** (10-20 points): Writing substantial prompts (20+ words)
- **Completeness**: Addressing multiple aspects

**Passing Score**: 60 points to advance to next level

## Features

### 1. Hints System
Stuck? Click **"Show Hint"** for progressive hints:
- First hint: General direction
- Second hint: Specific elements to include
- Third hint: More detailed guidance
- Fourth hint: Final nudge

### 2. Example System
Click **"Show Example"** to see a model prompt

**Note**: You should try to write your own version based on the example!

### 3. Feedback System
After submitting, you'll see:
- **Score** (0-100)
- **Feedback**: What you did well and what to improve
- **Matched Criteria**: List of elements you included
- **Options**: Try again or advance (if passed)

### 4. Try Again
Didn't pass? No problem! Click **"Try Again"** to revise your prompt with the feedback in mind.

## Tips for Success

1. **Read Carefully**: Understand the scenario and task
2. **Think Before Writing**: Plan what to include
3. **Be Specific**: Details matter!
4. **Add Context**: Help the AI understand your situation
5. **Specify Format**: Tell how you want results organized
6. **Include Constraints**: Time, budget, skill level, etc.
7. **Use Hints Wisely**: Try first, then use hints if stuck
8. **Learn from Examples**: Understand why good prompts work
9. **Iterate**: First attempt not perfect? Refine it!
10. **Apply to Real Life**: Use these skills with real AI tools!

## Real-World Applications

After completing Mission 3, you can use prompt engineering for:

- **Homework Help**: Get better explanations from AI tutors
- **Creative Writing**: Generate story ideas and outlines
- **Research**: Find information efficiently
- **Learning**: Understand complex topics
- **Problem Solving**: Break down challenges
- **Project Planning**: Organize ideas and tasks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Vague**: "Help me" → "Help me understand photosynthesis for 6th grade"
2. **Too Short**: "Write story" → "Write a 300-word mystery story for teens"
3. **No Context**: "Math help" → "7th grade algebra, stuck on word problems"
4. **No Format**: "Tell me about AI" → "List 5 AI benefits in bullet points"
5. **No Constraints**: "Recipe" → "Easy recipe under 30 minutes with common ingredients"

## Progression

As you advance through levels, prompts should become:
- More detailed
- Better contextualized
- More specific about format
- More comprehensive with constraints

## Scoring Breakdown Example (Level 1)

If your prompt is: "Write an exciting science fiction adventure story for middle school students about a robot explorer, set in the year 2100 on a distant planet, around 250 words long"

You'd score:
- ✓ Genre specified (science fiction, adventure): **20 points**
- ✓ Character mentioned (robot explorer): **20 points**
- ✓ Setting described (2100, distant planet): **20 points**
- ✓ Audience specified (middle school): **20 points**
- ✓ Length indicated (250 words): **20 points**
- ✓ Detailed prompt (25+ words): **10 bonus points**

**Total**: 110 points (capped at 100) → **Pass!**

## Points Earned

- Complete a level with 60-79 score: **30-40 points**
- Complete a level with 80-100 score: **40-50 points**
